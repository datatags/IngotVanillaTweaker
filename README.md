# IngotVanillaTweaker
Tired of some old vanilla mechanics that really need changing? Then this plugin may be for you! As of now, these 4 issues are addressed

Tweaked Mechanics
- xp dropped on death limited to 100 xp (~7 levels) (XPDeathDropFix)
- "Too Expensive!" tag and re-name costs costing more than 1 level (TooExpensiveFix)
- Obtain spawners with a silk touch pickaxe (SilkSpawners)
- Obtain budding amethyst with a silk touch pickaxe (SilkAmethyst)

permissions
- ingotvt.ivt: Allow players to use the base /ingotvanillatweaker command
- ingotvt.ivt.reload: Allow players to use the /ingotvanillatweaker reload command
- ingotvt.ivt.version: Allow players to use the /ingotvanillatweaker version command
- ingotvt.xpdeathdropfix.allow: Allow players to have the modified xp calculations on death
- ingotvt.tooexpensivefix.allow: Allow players to have the modified anvil calculations
- ingotvt.silkspawners.allow: Allow players to obtain spawners with a silk touch pickaxe
- ingotvt.silkamethyst.allow: Allow players to obtain budding amethyst with a silk touch pickaxe

Each of these have a permission you must give to the player to let them use it. There is also a config option to enable/disable them entirely, without needing to revoke the permissions from everyone.


                                                    (TooExpensiveFix) PLEASE READ THE PARAGRAPH BELOW!!!!!!â€‹
The actual "Too Expensive!" text CANNOT be removed, however you are still able to do the enchantment if you have enough levels. This unfortunately means you can't see the amount of levels you need to do the enchant in the anvil screen. It will instead output to a desired area (by default in chat. You can change this in config.yml). Also, for those using Geyser, bedrock users cannot take advantage of any of this due to bedrock client limitations. There is nothing I can do about that.
